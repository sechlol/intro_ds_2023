        <h2>Data Science Project Title</h2>
        <p>
            This is the introductory paragraph of your data science project blog post. You can provide an overview of the project, its objectives, and its significance.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here, you can continue to describe the data science project, the data you used, the methodology, and any interesting insights or results you obtained.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Details</h3>
        <p>
            You can include more specific details about the data, tools, and techniques used in your data science project.
        </p>

        <h3>Results and Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Summarize the results of your project and any conclusions or implications. You can also mention future work or areas for improvement.
        </p>

        <h3>Correlation gives you important insights about the market</h3>
        <p>
            Correlation is a statistical measure that describes how two assets are related. It can give perspective on the overall nature of the market. 
            We use Pearson correlation. The scale varies between -1 and +1. 
            Correlation of -1 indicates a perfectly linear negative correlation and +1 indicates a perfectly linear positive correlation. 
            Correlation of 0 indicates that there is no linear depency between the two assets. 
            So the higher the positive correlation, the more strongly the two assets vary together, 
            and the higher the negative correlation, the more strongly they vary together but in opposite directions.
        </p>

        <p>
            But what concrete information do correlations give you? 
            You might want to recognise which assets are correlated and uncorrelated with each other to assess the unsystematic risk in your portfolio. 
            You can identify if you have multiple assets that behave in the same way, thereby increasing your risk. 
            You can also identify assets that show very little correlation with the assets currently in your portfolio and explore them as potential diversification opportunities.
        </p>

        <p>
            By looking at the correlation over time, you get information about the relationship between two assets over different economic periods. 
            The interactive charts below allows you to examine the rolling 1-month correlation between the S&P 500 and the Energy sector, i.e. XLE, 
            and between the S&P 500 and the Crude Oil Prices, i.e DCOILWTICO.

        <p>
            By looking at the network of correlations, you can find out how all assets behave in relation to each other. This kind of network can be formed for certain periods of time.
            Below you can explore interactive network graphs, the first of which shows the 2007-2009 financial crisis and the second the 2020-2023 Covid-19 pandemic.
            From them you can easily find out: 
            (1) Which assets show the strongest and weakest correlations with each other? 
            (2) Annualised returns (Node sizes are proportional to the size of annualised returns and colours denote positive or negative returns). 
            (3) Annualised volatility.
